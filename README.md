# flameplusplus\_compiler
Flame++ is my idea for a High Level Language that targets the NES (and
maybe other systems too eventually).


A sort of short term goal is for Flame++ compiler will output code
targeting the NES by outputing ca65 assembly source files.



[Here](http://cc65.github.io/doc/ca65.html) is ca65
